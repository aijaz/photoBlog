## What is this?

This repository has two scripts that I use in conjunction with my
Octopress blog hosted at http://aijazansari.com/.

These scripts are used to generate a post that highlights a single
photograph (hence the name: photoBlog).

You can find notes on how to use these scripts in
[this blog post](http://aijazansari.com/2012/10/01/octopress-as-a-photoblog/).
